# CSC2463
For my CSC2463 Final Project, I made a small game in which you play as a submarine trying to survive until help arrives.
In order to survive, the player must dodge the bombs falling from above. As time goes on, the number of bombs falling 
increases and the tempo of the background music increases, starting at 100 bpm. Upon being hit by a bomb, the submarine 
explodes and the game over screen is shown, the music tempo is also set to a value of 60. If The player survives, a
victory screen is shown and the music is set back to its original tempo.

For a demonstration of the game with its arduino controlls, click [here](https://youtu.be/8sZ3zX7G8Og).
